Generate typed TypeScript SDKs for AI agents to interact with MCP servers. Converts verbose JSON-RPC curl commands to clean function calls (docs.createDocument() vs curl). Auto-detects MCP tools from server modules, generates TypeScript types and client methods, creates runnable example scripts.

Use when: building MCP-enabled applications, need typed programmatic access to MCP tools, want Claude Code to manage apps via scripts, eliminating manual JSON-RPC curl commands, validating MCP inputs/outputs, or creating reusable agent automation.
