Use this skill when stuck in circular debugging, when solutions aren't working despite multiple attempts, or when the user expresses frustration with lack of progress. Bring in GPT-5 as a third-party consultant to provide fresh perspective on complex technical problems, architectural decisions, or multi-system debugging issues. Ideal when you've tried multiple approaches without success, when the problem involves obscure edge cases or novel challenges, or when a second expert opinion would help break through an impasse. Gather all context from the conversation so far and present it comprehensively to GPT-5.
