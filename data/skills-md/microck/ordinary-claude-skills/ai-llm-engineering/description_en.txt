Operational skill hub for LLM system architecture, evaluation, deployment, and optimization (modern production standards). Links to specialized skills for prompts, RAG, agents, and safety. Integrates recent advances: PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning, hybrid RAG handoff (see dedicated skill), vLLM 24x throughput, multi-layered security (90%+ bypass for single-layer), automated drift detection (18-second response), and CI/CD-aligned evaluation.
