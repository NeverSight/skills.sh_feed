This skill should be used when the user asks to "monitor the PR", "watch the CI", "check if CI passes", "let me know when CI finishes", "watch the checks", "monitor CI status", "tell me when the build completes", or any variation requesting to track GitHub PR check status until completion. Also use this skill proactively after creating or updating a PR when the user would benefit from knowing the CI result.
