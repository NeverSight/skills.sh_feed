Generates git commit messages following Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification with semantic types (feat, fix, etc.), optional scope, and breaking change annotations. Use when committing code changes or creating commit messages. Triggers on phrases like 'commit', 'commit and push', 'make a commit', 'git commit', or when commit is part of a compound action (e.g., 'bump version and commit').
